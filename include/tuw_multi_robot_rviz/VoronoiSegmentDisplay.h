// Here we declare our new subclass of rviz::Display.  Every display
// which can be listed in the "Displays" panel is a subclass of
// rviz::Display.
//
// ImuDisplay will show a 3D arrow showing the direction and magnitude
// of the IMU acceleration vector.  The base of the arrow will be at
// the frame listed in the header of the Imu message, and the
// direction of the arrow will be relative to the orientation of that
// frame.  It will also optionally show a history of recent
// acceleration vectors, which will be stored in a circular buffer.
//
// The ImuDisplay class itself just implements the circular buffer,
// editable parameters, and Display subclass machinery.  The visuals
// themselves are represented by a separate class, ImuVisual.  The
// idiom for the visuals is that when the objects exist, they appear
// in the scene, and when they are deleted, they disappear.
